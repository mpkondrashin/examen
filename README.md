## Bugs

### Notifications
On Windows, if notifications are disabled not by the Sandboxer Options window, but by using Notification Center, then it is not possible to turn them back on.

### New version update
When Sandboxer shows that a new version is available, but upon downloading it shows an error, it means that the user has to wait several minutes and try again.

### Unregistration
If unregistration is not performed from the Options dialog and/or during uninstallation Deep Discovery Analyzer connection is not available, then Sandboxer will be kept on the Submitters list and the only option will be to remove it using Analyzer Web UI. After installing Sandboxer once more, it will just register one more submitter.

### Install error
If during the files copy phase, you encounter some error, try to return to the previous install phase and try again.

### Install crash
To make sure that your installation is completed, check the sandboxer_setup_wizard.log log file generated along the installer executable. The last line should contain the following: "... INFO G0001 Close Logging ...". If not, try to run the installer once more.

### macOS dark theme
If macOS uses a dark theme, it will be hard to see some text on the UI
